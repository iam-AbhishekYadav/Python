# # What is Python ?

- A programming language that can be used for many tasks, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
- An interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.


# # Basic Python Code

``` py
print ("Hello I am Abhishek Yadav")             Output : Hello I am Abhishek Yadav
```

# # Variables in Python

- Variables are containers that store information that can be manipulated and referenced later by the programmer within the code.

``` py
name = "Abhishek"   #type str
age = 20            #type int
passed = True       #type bool
```

- **Rules of naming Python Variables**
  - Variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
  - Variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
  - Variables are case sensitive.
  - Variable name cannot start with a number.

``` py
Color = "yellow"    #valid variable name
cOlor = "red"       #valid variable name
_color = "blue"     #valid variable name

5color = "green"    #invalid variable name
$color = "orange"   #invalid variable name
```

# # Input in Python

- **`input()`** statement is used to accept values (Using Keyboard) from user.
- **`input()`** ---> Result for input is always a string.
- **`int(input())`** ---> Result for input is always a int.
- **`float(input())`** ---> Result for input is always a float.

``` py
name = input("Enter your name : ")         Output : Enter your name : Abhishek Yadav
print("Welcome ", name)                    Output : Welcome Abhishek Yadav
```
